<p>Stuff about mangoes that I think is very important.</p>

<li> i think mangoes are very tasty and yummy to eat.</li>
  <li> I also think mangoes should be widely encouraged and celebrated in every country </li>

<li> The mango is the national fruit of Pakistan, India and the Philippines. It is also the national tree of Bangladesh. <li>
  <li> Mangoes are believed to have originated around 4,000 years ago in Southeast Asia, particularly in India and Burma (now Myanmar).</li>
  <li> Mangoes are very tasty and are very sweet.</li>
<li> The English name mango is likely derived from the Tamil word mankay or Keralan word mangga. When Portuguese traders settled in Southern India, they adopted the name as manga. It was as the British were trading with South India in the 15th and 16th Centuries that the word mango was born. <li>
  <li> The South Asian country produces over 18 million tonnes of the fruit, mostly for domestic consumption. <li>
<li>There are over 1,000 different varieties of mangoes worldwide, ranging in color, shape, flavor, and size. Some popular varieties include Alphonso, Tommy Atkins, Kent, and Ataulfo.</li>
